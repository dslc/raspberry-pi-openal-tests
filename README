# MP3 streaming tests

Some basic tests with MP3 streaming using libCURL and the mpg123 library.

# Audio API

In this version the OSS (Open Sound System) API is used for simplicity. 

On a Raspberry Pi, you may need to run

    sudo modprobe snd-pcm-oss

to load the OSS compatibility for ALSA.

# Building

## Dependencies

The only dependencies are:

  - libCURL
  - mpg123

To install these on a Debian-like system, try the following as root:

    apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libmpg123-dev 

## Running make

Simple type

    make test-stream

to build the program, and

    make clean

to remove it. (There is no `make install` option currently.)

# Running

The binary should be invoked as follows.

    ./test-stream <audio-device> <url>

Example:

    ./test-stream /dev/dsp https://designtrail.net/~david/audio/test1.mp3

## Controls

Type `p` to pause / resume. Type `q` to exit.
