# MP3 streaming tests

Some basic tests with MP3 streaming using libCURL and the mpg123 library.

# Audio API

In this version the OSS (Open Sound System) API is used for simplicity. 

On a Raspberry Pi, you may need to run

    sudo modprobe snd-pcm-oss

to load the OSS compatibility for ALSA.

# Running

The binary should be invoked as follows.

    ./test-stream <audio-device> <url>

Example:

    ./test-stream /dev/dsp https://designtrail.net/~david/audio/test1.mp3
